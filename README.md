This mod aims to provide a fresh user experience for War Thunder by altering the names of vehicles and weaponry to be more accurate to real-life, with some stylistic liberties taken here and there.

This mod also makes a host of fixes to grammar and conventions, primarily in the form of correcting capitalization errors.

A full list of changes can be found in the CHANGELOG file.
